		<h2>Sometimes people say important things</h2>
		<!-- description of next section -->
		<p>You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>
		<!-- quote -->

		<h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
		<!-- description -->
		<p>At least, not anymore...</p>

		<!-- title for next item -->
		<h3>Want bold text?</h3>
		<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
		<p>There's a <b>wrong</b> way and a <strong>right</strong> way. Always use the right way!</p>

		<!-- title for next item -->
		<h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
		<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
		<p>Again, it used to be done like this. This is <i>wrong</i>. This is the <em>right</em> way.</p>

		<!-- title for next item -->
		<h2>Separation of concerns</h2>
		<!-- description -->
		<p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<!-- title for next section -->
		<h2>Links</h2>
		<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
		<p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">place</a> to place on the internet.</p>

	<section>
		<!-- title for next section -->
		<h2>Sections</h2>
		<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
		     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
		<p>Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this</p>
